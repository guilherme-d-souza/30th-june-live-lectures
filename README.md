# Live Lectures Code Repository

Welcome!
This repository contains the code examples, demos, and resources from our live lectures.

Our goal is to make it easy for you to review the concepts covered in class, explore working examples, and use them as inspiration for your own projects.

## âœ… Best Practices

- Keep your local copy organized by not mixing lecture code with personal projects.
- If you spot an error or want to suggest an improvement, feel free to open a **pull request** or create an **issue**.
- Use this code as a learning tool â€” donâ€™t copy it directly into your project submissions unless you understand every line.
